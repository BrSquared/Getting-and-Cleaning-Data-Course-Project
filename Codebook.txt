Variables within the mergeddata.txt and summarydata.txt

-The variables used in the run.analysis.R script
- With the exception of subject and activity, all data is normalized fro -1 to 1

subjcet - Identifies which subject the data came from
activity - Identifies what the subject was doing whent he measurements were taken

- There are several variables summarizing the data for acceleration and gyroscopic readings
- Each of these variables was measured accross the X, Y, and Z axis denoted as - X, - Y, and - Z respectively)
- The mean and standard deviation of each sample was evaluate (denoted as -mean() and -std() respectively)
- This results in a total of 6 variables per listed variable below

tBodyAcc - The acceleration of the body 
tGravityAcc - The acceleration due to gravity
tBodyAccJerk - The jerk acceleration of the body
tBodyGyro - The gyroscopic movement of the body
tBodyGyroJerk- The jerk acceleration of the gyroscopic motion
